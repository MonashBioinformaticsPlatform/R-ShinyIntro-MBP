## What is Shiny

Shiny is an R package that makes it incredibly easy to build interactive web applications straight from your R code. It provides an easy way to present R data analysis interactively and over the web. It allows you to create complicated apps without any  prior knowledge of HTML, CSS or JavaScript

To use it, simply open up R Studio and:
```{r install_shiny, eval=T, echo = T}
#install.packages("shiny")
library(shiny)
```
Shiny essential wraps your R code and transforms it into a reactive, dynamic web app.

## Another R package - What's so special about Shiny?

It's easier than learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript, although you can use those to build your own custom Shiny elements

You don't need to port any of your R code into another language in order to build a web app

Incredible flexibility, you can generate dynamic UI elements and create interactive plots

It adds reproducibilty to your graphs

**YOU DON'T NEED TO GENERATE A BILLION PLOTS MANUALLY** 

It can easily be added to a markdown document - like this one!

## Example apps

Here are some apps made by Monash bioinformaticians:

* [Stuart's TCP app that went into his Nature paper: ](http://bioapps.erc.monash.edu.ezproxy.lib.monash.edu.au/TCP/) Stuart K. Archer, Nikolay E. Shirokikh, Traude H. Beilharz, & Thomas Preiss. (2016). Dynamics of ribosome scanning and recycling revealed by translation complex profiling. Nature, 2016.

* [Paul's Varistran app](http://rnasystems.erc.monash.edu:3838/pfh/2015/demo-varistran/)

* [Varistran github page](https://github.com/MonashBioinformaticsPlatform/varistran)

## Create your first Shiny App

### Activity 1: Creating a ShinyApp that prints "Hello, World!" {- .activity}
Create a new .R file, paste the following code inside, save it as app.R.

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
library(shiny) #1. calls the library `shiny`
ui <- fluidPage( #2. defines user interface, an HTML webpage
  "Hello, world!" # prints Hello, world! on webpage
)
server <- function(input, output, session) { #3. specifies app behavior
}
shinyApp(ui, server) # 4. starts Shiny application
```

Click on `Run App` in the top right corner (see fig below). Or you can also use the keyboard shortcut: Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Enter

### Breakdown of the code
This is a trivial Shiny app that performs 4 tasks:

1. Calls `shiny` package.

2. Defines user interface which in this case is an HTML webpage, for us to interact with. In this user interface, it prints "Hello, world!".

3. Creates a function called server that specifies app behavior. Currently, the function body is empty. It means this function (and the app) doesn't do anything except for printing "Hello, world!" We will later add more controls to this function to control app behavior.

4. Construct and start a Shiny application from UI and server.


In the R console, there is some text displayed in red which indicates the URL of your app. Your app can be found at 127.0.0.1, indicates "this computer" and 5537 is a randomly assigned port number.

### Activity 2: Now, open the `app_ui.R` inside `ShinyApps` folder and examine what it does.{- .activity}
