## What is Shiny

Shiny is an R package that makes it incredibly easy to build interactive web applications straight from your R code. It provides an easy way to present R data analysis interactively and over the web. It allows you to create complicated apps without any  prior knowledge of HTML, CSS or JavaScript

To use it, simply open up R Studio and:
```{r install_shiny, eval=T, echo = T}
#install.packages("shiny")
library(shiny)
```
Shiny essential wraps your R code and transforms it into a reactive, dynamic web app.

## Another R package - What's so special about Shiny?

It's easier than learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript, although you can use those to build your own custom Shiny elements

You don't need to port any of your R code into another language in order to build a web app

Incredible flexibility, you can generate dynamic UI elements and create interactive plots

It adds reproducibilty to your graphs

**YOU DON'T NEED TO GENERATE A BILLION PLOTS MANUALLY** 

It can easily be added to a markdown document - like this one!

## Example apps

Here are some apps made by Monash bioinformaticians:

* [Stuart's TCP app that went into his Nature paper: ](http://bioapps.erc.monash.edu.ezproxy.lib.monash.edu.au/TCP/) Stuart K. Archer, Nikolay E. Shirokikh, Traude H. Beilharz, & Thomas Preiss. (2016). Dynamics of ribosome scanning and recycling revealed by translation complex profiling. Nature, 2016.

* [Paul's Varistran app](http://rnasystems.erc.monash.edu:3838/pfh/2015/demo-varistran/)

* [Varistran github page](https://github.com/MonashBioinformaticsPlatform/varistran)

# Structure of a Shiny App

A basic Shiny app consists of two objects:

* ui object - contains the code for the UI (user interface) elements i.e the visible part of the app 

* server object - contains the code for all the calculations the app will need. Generates an output which is returned to the ui.
