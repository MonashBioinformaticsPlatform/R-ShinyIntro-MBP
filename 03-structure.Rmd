# Structure of a Shiny App{#structure}

A basic Shiny app consists of two objects:

* UI object - contains the code for the UI (user interface) elements i.e the visible part of the app; takes input and displays output.

* server object - contains the code for all the calculations the app will need. It contains the logical part of the code and access input from UI, performs the computation and generates an output which is returned to the UI.

The skeleton of every Shiny app looks like:
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  # front end interface
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  # back end logic
}

shinyApp(ui, server) # runs the app
```

## UI 
This is the front-end of the shiny app that allows you to capture (input) and display (output) a variety of data types. The UI object controls the layout and appearance of the app. The UI makes use of widgets to interact with data. Here, we'll look at examples of shinyWidgets that insert input conntrols.

```{r widget1, echo = T}
library(shiny)
sliderInput("slider1",
            label = h4("This code will make a slider \n"),
            min = 0, max = 100, value = 50)
```

```{r, echo= T, eval = F}
renderPrint({paste("The number selected by the slider is:", input$slider1)})
```

```{r}
fluidPage(
    
  # Copy the chunk below to make a group of checkboxes
  checkboxGroupInput("checkGroup", label = h3("Checkbox group"), 
    choices = list("Choice 1" = 1, "Choice 2" = 2, "Choice 3" = 3),
    selected = 1),
  
  
  hr(),
  fluidRow(column(3, verbatimTextOutput("value")))
  
)


```

## Widgets and layout
There is a wide variety of available widgets but all of them share a common basic framework. All widget input functions have the same first argument i.e. `inputID`. This is an identifier that connects the UI with the server. If `inputID = select`, you can access the input in the server as `input$select`. We'll discuss more about the server in the next section.

* The `inputID` is like a variable in R and must follow the naming convention. It must be a string that may contain only letters, numbers, and underscores.

* Like a variable, the `inputID` has to be unique so it can be accessed inside the server.

Here are some more examples of Shiny widgets:
```{r, echo = F}
shinyUI(navbarPage("Navbar",
                   tabPanel("Widgets!",
                            selectInput("select", label = h3("Select box"), 
                                        choices = list("Choice 1" = 1, "Choice 2" = 2, "Choice 3" = 3), 
                                        selected = 1),
                            renderPrint({input$select}),
                            textInput("text", label = h3("Text input"), value = "Enter text..."),
                            renderPrint({input$text})
                   ),
                   tabPanel("More widgets!",
                            checkboxGroupInput("checkGroup", label = h3("Checkbox group"), 
                                               choices = list("Circle" = "circle", "Square" = "square", "Triangle" = "triangle"),
                                               selected = "circle"),
                            
                            renderPrint({ input$checkGroup })
                   )
)
)

```

### Activity 3: Now, open the `widgets.R` inside `ShinyApps` folder, and try running it.{- .activity}
There are a variety of widgets available in Shiny Apps. Have a go at them!!

Please Note: For now, keep the `Server Logic` and `Run the App` as it is. We'll explain these in next sections.

## Server

The server object contains the code for building the app. It contains the code for data processing, analysis and plotting. It takes input from the UI, runs (and re-runs) code chunks defined within, generates output and sends it to the UI.

The server logic follows reactive programming, which defines a graph of dependencies. The idea is that when the input changes, all related outputs are updated. This makes the Shiny App interactive. 

In the Shiny skeleton code, server is defined as a function with three arguments- input, output and session. These arguments are created by Shiny when the session starts and cannot be changed.
```{r, eval = F}
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  # front end interface
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  # back end logic
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

### Input
This is a list-like object that contains input data from the UI. The input data can be accessed as `input$inputId`, where `inputId` is defined in the UI. For example, if we refer back to the check-box example in shiny widgets, we specified the `inputId` as `checkGroup`. We can access the value of the input using `input$checkGroup`. It will contain the value `1` as we specified this in the `selected` argument. This value will be updated everytime a user selects a different check-box.

```{r, eval = F}
ui <-  fluidPage(
  # Copy the chunk below to make a group of checkboxes
  checkboxGroupInput(inputId = "checkGroup",
                     label = h3("Checkbox group"),
                     choices = list("Choice 1" = 1,
                                    "Choice 2" = 2,
                                    "Choice 3" = 3),
                     selected = 1)
)
```

### Output
This is also a list-like object named according to the `outputId` created in the UI. In the following example, the `outputId` is defined as `greeting` inside the UI. Inside the server function, the output is stored in the `outputId` using `output$greeting` (think of it as a storing a value inside a variable). The value of the `greeting` is `Hello, World!`

```{r, eval = F}
ui <- fluidPage(
  textOutput(outputId =  "greeting") # defines outputID
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$greeting <- renderText("Hello, World!") # stores output in the outputID
}
```

The `render` function sets up a special "reactive context" that automatically tracks the input values the output has used. It also converts the output of your R code into HTML to be display on a web page.

### Challenge 1: Rewrite your `ui` to create a Shiny app that contains following:{- .challenge}

1. Title that says "Challenge 1"

2. Select `airquality` from the default datasets in R (Hint: Refer to `app_ui.R`).

3. Create three widgets:

   * `helpText()` to write "List of variables to choose from".
   
   * `selectInput()` to list variables in the `airquality` dataset. 
   
   * `sliderInput()` to add a slider where, `min = 0`; `max = 30` and selected values are: `(5,21)`
   
4. Try replacing the list options in selectInput by `colnames(airquality)`.

Your Shiny app should look like this:

> Hint: Use the Shiny skeleton code to create a new R-script and edit the UI part:

```{r, eval = F}
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  # edit this part
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```
