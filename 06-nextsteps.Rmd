## Going fancy with Shiny Dashboards
```{r, eval = F}
library(shinyashboard)
```

This is the skeleton code for creating Shiny dashboards. There are three components to a Shiny dashboard:

1. Header

2. Sidebar

3. Body

```{r, eval = F}
library(shiny)
library(shinydashboard)

ui <- dashboardPage(
    dashboardHeader(),
    dashboardSidebar(),
    dashboardBody()
)

server <- function(input, output) { }

shinyApp(ui, server)

```

## Interactive Documents

If you are familiar with writing R Markdown HTML documents, it is possible to embed Shiny widgets and render functions into them just be modifying the YAML header:

```
---
runtime: shiny
output: html_document
---
```

Then you can insert widgets and render functions into code chunks in the document:

```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
selectInput(inputId = "choice_select", label = "Select box",
            choices = list("Choice 1" = 1, "Choice 2" = 2, "Choice 3" = 3),
            selected = 1)

renderPlot({
    
    plot(x = airquality[, 4], y = airquality[, as.numeric(input$choice_select)])
  
  })

```




It is important to note that interactive R-Markdown documents must be hosted with Shiny Server or RStudio Connect like a normal shiny app otherwise the interactive functionality will not work. Interactive documents cannot be shared as a standalone html file, though the rmarkdown file can be shared and run locally.

## Render UI Elements From the Server Sidebar

Sometimes we may to generate a UI element that is updated in response to actions we take with other UI elements or in response to calculations that have happened on the server side e.g we have a numeric widget that is filtering the number of rows in a data-frame and we also want to have an `selectInput` based on the values in a column in that data-frame.

We can control this with a `uiOutput` - this function allows us to render a UI element from the server side. E.g:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
    sidebarPanel(
        numericInput(inputId = "filter", label = "Number of days to filter out", value = 1, 
            min = 0, max = 150),
        uiOutput("select_out") # We have an output element in the UI, this where the
        # the widget will be placed 
    ),
    mainPanel(
        textOutput(outputId = "text_out")
    )
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {

  filtered_data <- reactive({
      airquality$day_into <- paste0("Day", 1:nrow(airquality))
      n_rows <- nrow(airquality) - input$filter
      return(head(airquality, n = n_rows))
  })  
  
  output$select_out <- renderUI({
    
    filtered_df <- filtered_data()
    d_list <- c(filtered_df$day_into)
    d_list <- as.list(d_list)

    # we've used a selectInput widget here
    # we can use any input widget here
    selectInput(
        inputId = "day_select", label = "Select filtered day", choices = d_list,
        selected = "Day1"
    )
  })

  # even though that the widget was created
  # on the server side we still access it with
  # input$inputId
  output$text_out <- renderText({
      print(input$day_select)
  })
}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```
